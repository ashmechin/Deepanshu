With outsourcing the software development to these countries help in bringing down the overall cost compared to developing them locally and also help in getting the specialized services in terms of technical expertise.

In current scenario, Indian IT companies have a significant presence in global software development market and are in a state to give tough competition to any international service providers with their technical skills and management capabilities.
